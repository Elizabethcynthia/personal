          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Hi there i'm cynthia- a student,a web developer and one who loves nature and a dancer to. </p>
          <p>Thanks for dropping by!</p>
          <h3>What i do;</h3>
          <p>I'm currently a student at shofco learning the website, i also volunteer as a worker in neighour by schools. <br>I haven't join any university currently, but i know i will join one very soon.</p>
          <h3>My story;</h3>
          <p>As i have say i'm a web developer, and have just starter my journey now. <br>I'm not that perfect but i believe in myself that i will make it, even though some times i wish to quit like others. <br>As they say in life one must have ups and down, well to beginning with, it was not a smooth journey as you think. <br>Indeed in life for you to achive something you must increase effort.</p>
          <h3>Experience;</h3>
          <p>Due to what i have experience i can say, never judge a book by it's cover. <br>Because the book might be covered very well, but inside it is something harder, than you even thought.</p>
          <h3>Conclusion;</h3>
          <p>Overall i'm excited to grow in experience. Life is a studying process which one have to achive for him to get what he/she wants.</p>
